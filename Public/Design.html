        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The name of the game is The Legend of the Big Sword. it is an action side scroller with a focus on 2D combat with an oversized sword. It is inspired by the long history of side scrollers. The main mechanic that helps separate the game and make it stand out is the focus on the Big Sword it increases in size as you acquire experience. The giant sword came from the anime trope of oversized weapons which originates from the manga berserk by Kentaro Miura, this trope had later found its way to video games in the final fantasy 7 by Square Soft. The gameplay hook is to make the weight of the sword apparent through gameplay and have enemy types built around the move-set of the Sword.

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Gameplay</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The gameplay is built between 2 main pillars exploration and combat. You will fight using your Big sword with two main attacks a sweep that comes out fast and does small damage and an overhead swing that you must mash to get over your head if an enemy comes too close when doing the overhead you can kick the enemy to push them away from you.
            The enemies featured will be designed around your sword they will have spindly legs that you can sweep to knock down then you use the overhead slash to do the most damage.
            The addition of alternative swords will be implemented to add side objectives having unique properties to the base sword-based around the weight that determines how much you must mash the button to do the overhead. Damage determines the damage value of the weapons in two attacks.

        <h3 style="margin: 0;">Features</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The features for the player are basic movement left and right, and a jump. For the players combat you will have three methods of attack all being melee attacks an overhead that does damage and nothing else. A sweep that does damage stuns enemies, and a kick that does practically no damage but pushes the enemies back giving you some breathing room if they get too close. The game will feature enemies with simple AI they will move towards the player and do an attack when they are close, the player can interact with them in the form of damaging then stunning them or pushing them. The game will have Swords that you can find in optional rooms these weapons have varied properties but have the same consistent move set this is one of two incentives to keep playing. The other being the progression of the level system where you increase the damage of your weapon which is emphasized by your sword increasing size with each level up.

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Art Direction</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The art design of the game will take after dead cells techniques of creating 3D models and then pixelating them through post-processing. By doing this you have a much easier asset to animate and create a unique style while these techniques were used in dead cells by creating models with a unique design the art style stands separate from the game that inspired it. The background will not be created from 3D assets being post-processed but instead will be based on a tileset created in a pixel art program. One of the ways to help set it apart is a colour pallet that is simple and striking Monochromatic colours will be used throughout the level design to create a blank hollow feeling and red will be used to attract focus. Red is one of the most eye-catching colours and will be used for enemies and items it’ll stand out from the background. The Enemies will also be weird monsters only comprising of a head and some skinny spider legs. Like the player character will be created via 3D modelling software then rendered out as a sprite.

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Level Design</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The Level design will be simple to let the game focus on the gameplay while still incorporating aspects of exploration and platforming. The main topology is the hub and spoke comprising of the main room and 5 side rooms. The level has some verticality for exploration purposes. Due to the combat focus, you will always be moving forward occasional changing levels of elevation jumping over pits.
            A big focus of the level design is backtracking with fighting enemies being important the level won’t be too expansive, but you will have to go back and forth if you want to unlock side rooms. If you complete all the side rooms the final room will open, and you can complete the game. The enemy’s experience levels will be based on regions of the level so that the player will be forced to pick their fights and push players in specific directions. The level will also have a variety of tile-sets to help make the regions visually distinct to help with player navigation.
