        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The name of the game is The Legend of the Big Sword. it is an action game in the style of space invaders with a focus on 2D combat with an oversized sword. The main mechanic that helps separate the game from others and make it stand out is the focus on the Big Sword as it helps clear out large chunks of enemies. The giant sword came from the anime trope of oversized weapons which originates from the manga berserk by Kentaro Miura, this trope had later found its way to video games in the final fantasy 7 by Square Soft. The gameplay hook is to make the weight of the sword apparent through gameplay and have enemy’s be obliterated when used

        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The gameplay should familiar too any retro arcade fans as its very similar to space invaders with some twists. We had originally planned on the game being a 2D side-scroller but as time went on we felt that it was a little out our scope to produce a game as complicated as that. So we decided for something simpler but kinda give it a remix. So we went for a endless horde style invader game in which the player must cut down hordes of enemies with there iconic giant sword(and small one). As the player defeats more wave the enemies slowly get faster and faster to increase the challenge of the game as time goes on.

        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The player features are they can move left and right using the left and right arrow keys. They can use the up arrow to use sword that travels the entire distance of the screen, they have to be careful though because they can’t use it again until it hits an enemy or reach’s the end of the game screen. If the player hit the down arrow they will use the big sword, this sword has limited use’s and can take out massive waves of enemies, for each wave taken out the player will be given +1 use of the big sword, you will find that the player will end up stockpiling a lot of sword uses but these will diminish the longer the player can survive.

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Art Direction</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            For the art direction we wanted to stick our original plan, so we decided to stick as close as possible by making some of our own pixel art/sprites using the software aseprite and sourcing some from online. We felt that the 2D art style helps build a very stylised world that hold up better to the test of time as it is seen that games with cartoonish or pixel art age fairly well in terms of looks. We also wanted to stick to the original colour scheme we had planned using red, black and grey, the way we use these colours helps distinguish the different objects in the game like grey being the landscape and the red being the colour of the enemies.

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Level Design</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The level design for the game will very familiar obviously at first glance seeing that the game is very similar to space invaders but we have made some changes in terms of how enemies work. Instead of clearing a wave and moving onto the next level we decided to make the game about how long you can survive on the first level by having more waves spawn after you defeat the first. this alone obviously doesn't seem very difficult but as time goes on and the more you defeat the enemies wave will get faster and faster so the player will have to react faster and faster each time. we also included to text based info objects one to keep your score and one to keep track of you uses of the big sword. as for other level design features we also decided it would too easy if the player could just dodge the enemies to avoid losing so we also made the platform your standing something that needs to be protected.
