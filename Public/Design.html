        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The name of the game is The Legend of the Big Sword. it is an action game in the style of space invaders with a focus on 2D combat with an oversized sword. The main mechanic that helps separate the game from others and make it stand out is the focus on the Big Sword as it helps clear out large chunks of enemies. The giant sword came from the anime trope of oversized weapons which originates from the manga berserk by Kentaro Miura, this trope had later found its way to video games in the final fantasy 7 by Square Soft. The gameplay hook is to make the weight of the sword apparent through gameplay and have enemy’s be obliterated when used

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Gameplay</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The gameplay should familiar too any retro arcade fans as its very similar to space invaders with some twists. We had originally planned on the game being a 2D side-scroller but as time went on we felt that it was a little out our scope to produce a game as complicated as that. So we decided for something simpler but kinda give it a remix. So we went for a endless horde style invader game in which the player must cut down hordes of enemies with there iconic giant sword(and small one). As the player defeats more wave the enemies slowly get faster and faster to increase the challenge of the game as time goes on.

        <h3 style="margin: 0;">Features</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The player features are they can move left and right using the left and right arrow keys. They can use the up arrow to use sword that travels the entire distance of the screen, they have to be careful though because they can’t use it again until it hits an enemy or reach’s the end of the game screen. If the player hit the down arrow they will use the big sword, this sword has limited use’s and can take out massive waves of enemies, for each wave taken out the player will be given +1 use of the big sword, you will find that the player will end up stockpiling a lot of sword uses but these will diminish the longer the player can survive.

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Art Direction</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The art design of the game will take after dead cells techniques of creating 3D models and then pixelating them through post-processing. By doing this you have a much easier asset to animate and create a unique style while these techniques were used in dead cells by creating models with a unique design the art style stands separate from the game that inspired it. The background will not be created from 3D assets being post-processed but instead will be based on a tileset created in a pixel art program. One of the ways to help set it apart is a colour pallet that is simple and striking Monochromatic colours will be used throughout the level design to create a blank hollow feeling and red will be used to attract focus. Red is one of the most eye-catching colours and will be used for enemies and items it’ll stand out from the background. The Enemies will also be weird monsters only comprising of a head and some skinny spider legs. Like the player character will be created via 3D modelling software then rendered out as a sprite.

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Level Design</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            The Level design will be simple to let the game focus on the gameplay while still incorporating aspects of exploration and platforming. The main topology is the hub and spoke comprising of the main room and 5 side rooms. The level has some verticality for exploration purposes. Due to the combat focus, you will always be moving forward occasional changing levels of elevation jumping over pits.
            A big focus of the level design is backtracking with fighting enemies being important the level won’t be too expansive, but you will have to go back and forth if you want to unlock side rooms. If you complete all the side rooms the final room will open, and you can complete the game. The enemy’s experience levels will be based on regions of the level so that the player will be forced to pick their fights and push players in specific directions. The level will also have a variety of tile-sets to help make the regions visually distinct to help with player navigation.
