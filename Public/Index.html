            The Legend of the Big Sword is the game we have decided to develop which was heavily inspired by other video games and manga such as Final Fantasy 7, Devil May Cry and Berserk.
            The game follows the main character with his oversized sword, as the player progresses through the game the sword will get larger with each enemy defeated.
            The Goal of the game is to defeat as many enemies as can as you progress to the end of the level.
